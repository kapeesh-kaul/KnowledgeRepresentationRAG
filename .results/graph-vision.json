According to Sarma, Gandhi recruited women and gave them new self-confidence and dignity, while other scholars like Marilyn French state that Gandhi barred women from joining due to concerns about being accused of using them as a \"political shield.\" Regardless, thousands of Indian women did join the Salt March to defy British salt taxes.",

He advocated for a reduction in consumption and waste, encouraging people to live off the land and use natural resources wisely. In his book \"Hind Swaraj,\" Gandhi wrote about the importance of using local materials and traditional crafts, as well as promoting sustainable agriculture practices.\n\nIn 1944, Gandhi launched the \"Swadeshi Movement\" in India, which aimed to promote self-sufficiency and reduce dependence on foreign goods. The movement encouraged people to use locally made products, reuse and recycle materials, and adopt simple living habits.\n\nIt's worth noting that while Gandhi did not specifically use the term \"sustainable living,\" his ideas on environmentalism and social justice were well ahead of their time and continue to influence contemporary discussions on sustainability.",
