He later moved to Rajkot, a nearby city, to attend high school at the Kapil Thakkar High School. However, he dropped out of school at the age of 13 due to family circumstances.\n\nGandhi's early education was influenced by his father, Karamchand Gandhi, who was a devout Hindu and a strong advocate for social reform. His mother, Putlibai Gandhi, also played an important role in shaping his values and principles.\n\nIt is worth noting that the query results do not provide detailed information on Gandhi's formative experiences or major life events beyond his early education.

          "expected": "Gandhi spent 21 years in South Africa (1893-1914) where he developed his political views and philosophy of nonviolent resistance. He faced racial discrimination which led him to fight for civil rights, developing the concept of Satyagraha (truth-force) and becoming a leader in the Indian community's struggle against injustice.",
          "actual": "**Gandhi's Experience in South Africa**\n\nGandhi's experience in South Africa played a significant role in shaping his philosophy of non-violent resistance, which he would later apply in India's struggle for independence.\n\nIn 1893, Gandhi traveled to South Africa as a young lawyer to work on a case against the British colonial government. At the time, Gandhi was only 24 years old and had recently graduated from law school in London. He arrived in Durban, South Africa, where he faced racial discrimination and prejudice against Indians living in the country.\n\n**The Natal Indian Congress and the Satyagraha Movement**\n\nGandhi soon became involved with the Natal Indian Congress, an organization fighting for equal rights for Indians in South Africa. In 1894, Gandhi was appointed as the president of the Congress, but he resigned after a year due to disagreements within the organization.\n\nHowever, this experience had a lasting impact on Gandhi. He began to develop his ideas about non-violent resistance and civil disobedience, which would later become the hallmark of his movement in India. In 1906, Gandhi returned to South Africa and became involved with the Indian community again, leading a campaign against the \"Black Act,\" a law that discriminated against Indians.\n\nThe experience in South Africa was a formative period for Gandhi, where he developed his leadership skills and refined his ideas about non-violent resistance. He later wrote extensively about this period in his autobiography, \"My Experiments with Truth.\"\n\n**Influence on Gandhi's Later Life**\n\nGandhi's experiences in South Africa had a lasting impact on his life and work. The Satyagraha movement, which he founded during this time, would become the core of his non-violent resistance strategy in India. He applied these principles to various movements, including the Indian independence struggle and the civil rights movement in the United States.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nGandhi's experience in South Africa was a pivotal moment in his life, where he developed his ideas about non-violent resistance and leadership. This period had a lasting impact on his work and influenced his later struggles for social justice and equality.",

          "actual": "**Key Principles of Mahatma Gandhi**\n\nGandhi's core principles, as outlined in his non-violent resistance movement, revolved around Satyagraha (insistence on truth), Swaraj (self-rule), and Sarvodaya (welfare of all).

He drew inspiration from Leo Tolstoy's book \"The Kingdom of God is Within You\" and the writings of Henry David Thoreau.\n2.  **Simple Living**: Gandhi advocated for simple living and self-sufficiency. He believed that individuals should be content with minimal needs, as this would allow them to focus on more important issues.\n3.  **Economic Self-Sufficiency**: Gandhi emphasized the importance of economic self-sufficiency for India's independence. He promoted the idea of \"swadeshi\" (self-reliance) and encouraged Indians to produce their own goods rather than relying on foreign imports.\n\n**Notable Campaigns**\n\nSome notable campaigns where Gandhi implemented these principles include:\n\n*   The 1917 Champaran Satyagraha, where he fought against British exploitation in the Bihar region.\n*   The 1930 Salt March, a 24-day march to the sea to protest the British salt tax.\n*   The Quit India Movement (1942), which called for immediate independence from Britain.\n\n**Influence and Legacy**\n\nGandhi's principles have influenced civil rights movements across the world. His philosophy of non-violent resistance has inspired leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela, and Aung San Suu Kyi.",
