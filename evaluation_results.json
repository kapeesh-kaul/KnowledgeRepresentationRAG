However, based on my knowledge, some notable campaigns associated with Mahatma Gandhi include:\n\n- The Non-Cooperation Movement (1920-1922): This campaign aimed to challenge British rule by encouraging Indians not to cooperate with the colonial government in various ways, such as paying taxes, serving on juries, and buying products from Britain.\n- The Salt March (1930): A 24-day march from Ahmedabad to Dandi to protest the British salt tax, which was seen as an affront to India's right to self-sufficiency.\n- The Quit India Movement (1942): This campaign called for immediate independence from British rule and featured widespread protests, civil disobedience, and acts of defiance against the colonial authorities.\n\nWhile Gandhi himself is not included in the list provided, some other notable figures related to him are:\n\n* Gandhian socialism: A political ideology that emphasizes self-reliance, non-violence, and social justice.\n* Gandhi cap: A type of hat or headgear that was popularized during Gandhi's time as a symbol of resistance against British rule.\n\nUnfortunately, there seems to be limited information available on the other individuals listed in the results, such as Sonia Gandhi and Sanjay Gandhi.",
