          "prompt": "Where and when was Mahatma Gandhi born, and what was his early education like?",
          "expected": "Mahatma Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, Gujarat, India. He studied law in London at the Inner Temple and was called to the bar in 1891. His early education in India was at local schools in Porbandar and Rajkot.",
          "actual": "Mahatma Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, a small coastal town in the state of Gujarat, India. His early education was limited, and he was homeschooled by his parents. In 1888, at the age of 19, Gandhi moved to South Africa to work as an apprentice in a local law firm.\n\nGandhi's experiences in South Africa had a significant impact on his life and political career. He was exposed to the harsh realities of racial segregation and discrimination, which led him to develop his philosophy of non-violent resistance, known as Satyagraha. In 1906, Gandhi adopted this methodology during a mass protest meeting in Johannesburg, where he urged Indians to defy the new law requiring registration of their population.\n\nIn 1909, Gandhi published his book Hind Swaraj, which declared that British rule had been established in India with the co-operation of Indians and would collapse if Indians refused to co-operate. At the age of 40, Gandhi's ideas about Indian independence and self-rule began to gain traction.\n\nGandhi returned to India in 1915 and became involved in the Indian independence movement. He was influenced by the Tamil moral text Tirukku\u1e5ba\u1e37 and the writings of Leo Tolstoy. In his struggle for Indian independence, Gandhi worked closely with other leaders, including Jawaharlal Nehru, who later described Gandhi's socialism as differing from Western socialism due to its emphasis on non-violence.\n\nIn 1942, Gandhi demanded immediate independence for India, which led to widespread protests and arrests. The British responded by imprisoning Gandhi and tens of thousands of Congress leaders. Meanwhile, the Muslim League, led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah, pushed for a separate homeland for Muslims in Pakistan. This led to the eventual partition of India in 1947.\n\nThroughout his life, Gandhi remained committed to non-violent resistance and public service. He continued to advocate for Indian independence until his assassination on January 30, 1948.",

          "expected": "Gandhi spent 21 years in South Africa (1893-1914) where he developed his political views and philosophy of nonviolent resistance. He faced racial discrimination which led him to fight for civil rights, developing the concept of Satyagraha (truth-force) and becoming a leader in the Indian community's struggle against injustice.",
          "actual": "**Gandhi's Experience in South Africa and its Influence**\n\nMahatma Gandhi spent approximately 21 years in South Africa (1893-1914), where he gained significant experience that profoundly influenced his later life and work. During this period, Gandhi worked as a lawyer and became involved in the Indian community's struggles against colonial oppression.\n\nGandhi's early experiences in South Africa began in 1893 when he traveled to the Transvaal region to work on a diamond mine. He was initially employed by a firm that provided contracts for Indian laborers, but soon took up legal work himself. In 1896, Gandhi moved to Johannesburg and opened his own law practice.\n\nIn 1902, during the Natal Indian Congress's protest against the registration Act of 1902, Gandhi adopted his method of Satyagraha (devotion to the truth) for nonviolent protests for the first time. This approach emphasized suffering, persuasion, and public relations skills. Gandhi used this strategy to resist the colonial authorities and the registration Act.\n\nGandhi's experiences in South Africa also led him to develop his unique style of dress, which became an iconic symbol of Indian identity. He popularized a simple cap, known as the \"khadi\" hat or \"Gandhi cap,\" which was made from locally sourced cotton. This attire reflected Gandhi's emphasis on cultural pride and self-reliance.\n\nAfter returning to India in 1915, Gandhi incorporated his South African experiences into his Indian independence movement. He used Satyagraha techniques to organize protests, nonviolent resistance, and civil disobedience. His message of truth, nonviolence, and self-reliance resonated deeply with the Indian people.\n\n**Timeline:**\n\n* 1893-1914: Gandhi spent 21 years in South Africa.\n* 1902: Gandhi adopted Satyagraha for the first time during the Natal Indian Congress's protest against the registration Act.\n* 1906: The Transvaal government promulgated a new Act compelling registration of the colony's Indian and Chinese populations, prompting Gandhi to lead a mass protest meeting in Johannesburg on September 11th.\n\n**Influences and Significance:**\n\nGandhi's experiences in South Africa deeply influenced his later life and work. His approach to nonviolent protests, simple dress, and emphasis on cultural pride and self-reliance became iconic symbols of Indian identity. Gandhi's influence extended beyond India, shaping the global movement for civil rights and social justice.\n\nNote: The information provided is based on the provided query results from the knowledge graph, which may not be exhaustive or entirely accurate.",

          "actual": "Gandhi's Major Campaigns in the Indian Independence Movement\n\nMahatma Gandhi was a key figure in India's struggle for independence from British rule. His campaigns and movements played a significant role in shaping the country's history.\n\nEarly Life and Influence (1869-1915)\nGandhi was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, Gujarat, India. He grew up in a Hindu family and was influenced by his parents' strong sense of social justice and morality. Gandhi studied law in London, where he became exposed to the ideas of Henry David Thoreau and Leo Tolstoy, which shaped his philosophy of non-violent resistance.\n\nNon-Cooperation Movement (1920-1922)\nIn 1920, Gandhi launched the Non-Cooperation Movement, which aimed to boycott British goods and institutions. He encouraged Indians to wear khadi cloth, boycott British titles and honors, and resign from government employment. The movement gained widespread popularity, but was met with violence and repression by the British authorities.\n\nQuit India Movement (1942)\nDuring World War II, Gandhi intensified his demand for independence, calling for the British to \"Quit India\" in a 1942 speech in Mumbai. This movement, also known as the Quit India Movement, was marked by widespread civil disobedience and protests. The British responded quickly, arresting Gandhi and other leaders of the Congress Party.\n\nDirect Action Day and Partition (1946)\nIn August 1946, the Muslim League, led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah, organized a Direct Action Day in Calcutta, which sparked violence against Hindus and the torching of their property. The British government failed to intervene, leading to a wave of retaliatory violence across India. Gandhi visited riot-prone areas to appeal for calm.\n\nKey Dates:\n\n* 1920: Non-Cooperation Movement begins\n* 1922: Gandhi is arrested and sentenced to six years' imprisonment\n* 1942: Quit India Movement begins\n* 1946: Direct Action Day sparks violence and partition\n\nGandhi's campaigns and movements had a profound impact on India's struggle for independence. His philosophy of non-violent resistance inspired millions of Indians to take part in civil disobedience and protests, ultimately contributing to the country's freedom from British rule in 1947.",
